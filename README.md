# WhatsApp Chat Analyzer
The WhatsApp Chat Analyzer is a Python-based tool that performs comprehensive analysis on exported WhatsApp chat data. It uses a combination of natural language processing, machine learning, and graph theory to provide insights into various aspects of chat activity and participant interaction.

# Key Features:
### Data Parsing and Preprocessing:

The tool extracts relevant metadata such as timestamps, sender information, and message content from WhatsApp chat exports.
Preprocessing steps include cleaning text, handling emojis, removing stopwords, and tokenization for further analysis.
Message Activity Analysis:

Pandas and NumPy libraries are used to analyze message frequency, response times, and active periods, offering insights into individual or group engagement.
Sentiment Analysis:

scikit-learn (sklearn) is employed for sentiment analysis using pre-trained models (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes). This helps in classifying messages as positive, negative, or neutral.
Tokenized messages can also be vectorized using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Bag of Words approaches from sklearn.
Participant Behavior Modeling:

Using scikit-learn, clustering techniques (like K-means) or classification models can group participants based on their interaction patterns, sentiment distribution, or frequency of messages.
Network Analysis of Participants:

NetworkX library is employed to construct communication networks, where participants are represented as nodes and interactions (e.g., messages exchanged) as edges.
Various graph algorithms, such as degree centrality, closeness, and betweenness, can help identify influential participants or key hubs in the conversation network.
Visualization:

Matplotlib and Seaborn can be used to plot message frequency, sentiment distribution, or participant activity over time.
NetworkX can also visualize participant interaction networks, highlighting central figures or clusters.
# Python Libraries:
# pandas:
Data manipulation and cleaning of chat logs.
# NumPy:
Mathematical operations for efficient data handling.
# scikit-learn:

# NetworkX:
Graph construction and network analysis for mapping participant interactions.
# Matplotlib/Seaborn: 
Visualization of insights such as sentiment trends, activity heatmaps, and interaction networks.

This tool is highly customizable, allowing you to plug in your own models or preprocessing techniques for specific analyses of WhatsApp chat data.
